The shutdown-command has different images and messages, depending on if Andre_601 is using the command or not.
The bot has 20 Commands. (7 in Fun, 6 in Info, 1 in NSFW, 2 in Server and 4 in a not seen category)
GitHub literally saved this bot. Without it, the code would be gone!
It took Andre_601 multiple tries and the help of 4 different devs, to get the Info-command working correctly in DM.
The Bot is used on the official nekos.life Discord.
Some code of the Bot is inspired by other bots (PowerSuggestion, FlareBot, NekoBeta) and a Spigot-plugin (DiscordSRV)
The bot actually converts the verification levels "high" and "very_high" into their corresponding image (`(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻` and `┻━┻ ミ ヽ(ಠ益ಠ)ﾉ 彡 ┻━┻`)
The version of the bot would actually be much higher, but Andre_601 is too lazy to update it every time.
This bot is actually a female and sees herself as Andre_601's daughter.
This is actually just a random message... because why not :P
